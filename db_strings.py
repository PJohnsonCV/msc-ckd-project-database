# SQL STRINGS
# abstracted to make it clearer when editing dbmethods. Various selects to get specific data, added as necessary
# - PATIENT strings
# - SAMPLE strings
# - RESULT strings
# - ANALYTE string(s?)
# - LINEAR REGRESSION strings

# Version 2 schema removes most/all link tables for ease of programming simple queries for quick answers
# it was such a pain finding the right combination and order of JOIN statements to perform individual tasks
# v2 is just patient, sample (with patient ID), result (with sample ID), no foreign keys or linked lists
# I know its not the "correct" way, but for a personal project and a simple database, its sufficient.
